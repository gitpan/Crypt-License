If you didn't read this first, then your Makefile complained about
not being able to find Crypt::C_LockTite. The missing module is
part of the Crypt::CapnMidNite distribution.

Edit the CapnMidNite MakeFile.PL to select the C_LockTite name
remake and install C_LockTite. 

WARNING, do not install the License module tools or C_LockTite
on your target production server. They are unneeded for License to 
function in 'decode only' mode. The presence of the tools with their
embedded License 'seed' will compromise the security of the License
installation. 'seed' may be a string of any length. The MD5 hash of
the 'seed' is used to produce the encryption key.

MAKE SURE and edit makeCert.pl to include the unique 'seed' for your 
installation. Change 'License.txt' to suite your needs, it is what I 
use as a license for my clients and is only an example.

now :-))

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
