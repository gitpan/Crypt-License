Crypt::License

Read INSTALL for information about missing module Crypt::LockTite

This module set provides tools to effectively obfuscate perl source
code and allow it to be decoded and executed based on host server, user,
expiration date and other parameters. Further, decoding and execution can be
set for a system wide key as well as a unique user key.

In addition, there are a set of utilities that provide email notification of
License expiration and indirect use of the encrypted modules by other
standard modules that may reside on the system. i.e. sub-process calls by
Apache-AuthCookie while not in user space.

Tools and Makefile.PL additions are included to allow the creation of
encrypted distribution "binaries" with commands

	make crypt
	make cryptdist

Basic operation:

Encryption uses a modified RC4 algorithim to convert the text perl file into
a "binary" consisting of bits -- this is a non-text file. When perl attempts
to load the module if first encounters "use Crypt::License;" at the
beginning of the file which in turn decrypts the stream of "bits" and
delivers it directly to the perl interpreter.
