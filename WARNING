WARNING: Version 2.03 contains a change to the way that the "hostname" is
determined. In previous versions, hostname was extracted by means of the
hard coded call '/bin/hostname --long'. This is not implemented on all
platforms and thus does not work for some installations of Crypt::License.

This call has been replaced with a call to Sys::Hostname::hostname which is
a part of the standard Perl distribution and is implemented on all known
platforms. HOWEVER, the returned string is usually the SHORT version of
the hostname. This may break some existing License certificates and require 
re-authorization / replacement of the keys when upgrading from versions 2.02
and earlier.
